# Staking Pool

## Project Description
Staking Pool is a decentralized Ethereum-based smart contract project that allows users to stake their ETH in a shared pool and earn rewards. It is built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Project Vision
To create a secure and transparent platform for decentralized staking where users can earn passive rewards by locking their assets. The goal is to simplify DeFi staking for the average user while maintaining robust smart contract security.

## Key Features
- ✅ Stake ETH securely
- ✅ Earn rewards based on the staked amount
- ✅ Withdraw staked funds at any time
- ✅ Owner-controlled parameters (future improvements)

## Future Scope
- 🔄 Support for ERC20 token staking
- 📊 Real-time reward calculation based on block time or APR
- 🧾 User dashboard integration (frontend)
- 🔐 Admin-controlled emergency stop or pause functionality
- 🧠 Integration with AI for risk assessment and yield optimization
